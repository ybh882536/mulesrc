     * The discovery process works as follows:
     * <ul>
     * <li>It scans the classpath looking for the files in the path META-INF/extensions/mule.extensions</li>
     * <li>The found files are assumed to be text files in which one canonical class name is found per line</li>
     * <li>Those classes are loaded and registered as {@link org.mule.extensions.introspection.api.Extension}s</li>
     * </ul>

     * If an {@link org.mule.extensions.introspection.api.Extension} is found which is already registered,
     * then this manager will apply whatever policy finds more convenient to decide if the existing
     * registration is kept or replaced. That is up to the implementation. The only thing this contract
     * guarantees is that each extension type will be registered only once and that the discovery process
     * will not fail if many discovery runs are triggered over the same classpath.
     * <p/>
     * Finally, a {@link java.util.List} will be returned with the {@link org.mule.extensions.introspection.api.Extension}s
     * that were registered or modified. For instance, the first time this method is invoked, all the discovered extensions
     * will be returned. If it's then called again, the extensions that are already registered will not be present
     * in the newly returned list, only those that were not there the first time or that were modified. If no extensions
     * are found, or nothing has changed since the last discovery, then an empty list is returned
